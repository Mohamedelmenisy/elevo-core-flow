        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
         <p class="date">Last Updated: [Date, e.g., October 26, 2023]</p>

        <p>Hello! This is Mohamed. Your privacy is important to me as you engage with the Coaching & Leadership Course ("Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your personal information when you sign up and use the related account services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>When you sign up, I collect the following personal information directly from you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Name:</strong> To personalize your experience and communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> To create your account, communicate with you about the course (updates, information, support), and for password recovery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I may also collect technical information automatically, such as IP address or browser type, for security and analytical purposes (e.g., to understand how the signup page is used), but this is generally not linked directly to your personal identity unless needed for security investigations.</p>
        <p><strong>Note on Passwords:</strong> While you create a password, I store it using secure hashing methods. This means I cannot see your actual password, only verify it when you log in.</p>


        <h2>2. How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>I use the information I collect primarily to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and manage your account for the Service.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you regarding your account, course updates, support requests, and other relevant information about the Coaching & Leadership Course.</li>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
            <li>Ensure the security of the platform and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How I Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is paramount. <strong>I do not sell your personal information to third parties.</strong></p>
        <p>I may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> I might use third-party companies to help operate the Service (e.g., hosting providers, email services). These providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their tasks and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if I have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect my rights, your safety, or the safety of others, or to investigate fraud.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>I take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. This includes using secure connections (HTTPS) and hashing passwords. However, please understand that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>I will retain your personal information (name and email) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service and fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. I may also retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (like record-keeping or security).</p>

        <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Requesting a copy of the personal information I hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Requesting correction of inaccurate information.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Requesting deletion of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions (e.g., legal requirements).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, please contact me directly using the email address provided below. I will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you believe I have inadvertently collected such information, please contact me so I can remove it.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If I make significant changes, I will notify you via the email associated with your account or by posting a notice on the platform before the change becomes effective. I encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Me</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how I handle your data, please don't hesitate to contact me:</p>
        <p><strong>Mohamed</strong><br>
           Email: <strong>[Your Contact Email Address]</strong></p>
