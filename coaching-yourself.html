    <h1>4. Coaching Yourself</h1>
    
    <div class="container">
        <div class="highlight-section">
            <p>Deep down, your team members likely already know the answers to their problems. As a coach, your job is to guide them toward this realization.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>One-on-one coaching is a great way to provide this guidance. It's the most common form of coaching, and it's valuable in many ways. For example, it can help your team members to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Identify career goals, and develop plans to achieve them</li>
            <li>Improve their time-management and organizational skills</li>
            <li>Find the right work-life balance</li>
            <li>Make better decisions</li>
            <li>Develop skills to work more effectively</li>
            <li>Reduce stress</li>
            <li>Build more productive work relationships</li>
            <li>Think positively</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In an individual coaching relationship, it's important that you are humble, and that you always respect the other person's opinions. Never assume that you have the "right" answer. Make suggestions, but think of yourself as a partner, not a teacher. Remember that most of the time, the solutions to whatever issues your team members have lie within themselves.</p>
        
        <p>In this chapter, we'll look at some useful models that you can use to frame your one-on-one coaching conversations. We'll also discuss how to build successful coaching relationships, and how you can use coaching techniques informally, as well as in structured sessions.</p>

            <p>Effective one-on-one coaching builds trust and facilitates personal growth</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4.1. Useful Coaching Models</h2>
        
        <p>You may feel a little daunted by the prospect of coaching another person. After all, if you're like most leaders, you probably haven't received any formal coaching training. So, how do you know what to do or say to guide your team member effectively?</p>
        
        <p>Fortunately, there are many established models, techniques and approaches that you can use to structure your coaching sessions.</p>
        
        <div class="model-section">
            <h3>1. The GROW Model</h3>
            <p>The GROW Model is a simple, yet powerful, coaching tool. GROW stands for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal</strong> - What does your team member want to achieve?</li>
                <li><strong>Reality</strong> - What is the current situation?</li>
                <li><strong>Options</strong> - What could your team member do?</li>
                <li><strong>Will</strong> - What will your team member do?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As a manager, you've likely already identified many of your team member's issues, and that's OK. You can still use the GROW Model as a guide that can help her to explore ideas, to come to her own conclusions, and to identify what she wants to achieve.</p>
            
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552664730-d307ca884978?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80"

                     loading="lazy">
                <p>The GROW Model provides a structured approach to coaching</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>To use the GROW Model, follow these steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establish a goal</strong> - Help your team member identify what she wants to accomplish</li>
                <li><strong>Examine the person's situation</strong> - Explore the current reality</li>
                <li><strong>Explore the options (or obstacles)</strong> - Brainstorm possible approaches</li>
                <li><strong>Agree a plan</strong> - The coachee identifies the steps that he needs to take, and commits to specific actions that will move him toward his goal. At this point it's useful to discuss how he will stay motivated, and the strategies that he'll use to overcome any obstacles that arise. Finally, set a date to review his progress, and to revise the plan if necessary.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="model-section">
            <h3>2. The Skill/Will Matrix</h3>
            <p>Your team members all have their own needs, personalities, skills and abilities. This means that you will need to tailor your approach to fit each individual.</p>
            
            <p>The Skill/Will Matrix, developed by coach and author Max Landsberg in 2003, can enable you to find the appropriate coaching style for every situation.</p>
            
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579389083078-4e7018379f7e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" 
                     alt="Skill/Will Matrix illustration"
                     loading="lazy">
                <p>Figure 1 – The Skill/Will Matrix</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The matrix is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant represents a different coaching style:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guide</strong> - This approach is best for people who have high will, but low skill</li>
                <li><strong>Delegate</strong> - Use this with people who have high skill and high motivation</li>
                <li><strong>Direct</strong> - Use this approach with people who have low skill and low will</li>
                <li><strong>Excite</strong> - Use this for people who have high skill, but low motivation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For example, if you are working with someone in the Direct quadrant, you might want to set clear guidelines, manage her progress closely, and encourage her to discuss any deadlines with you. But you could take a more "hands off" approach to coaching a team member who falls into the Delegate quadrant.</p>

            <h3>3. Solution-Focused Coaching</h3>
            <p>The Solution-Focused Coaching approach helps you to identify what your team member wants, and how he can achieve it. Your aim is not to examine why a specific problem is occurring, but to find a solution. This helps you to avoid dwelling on the negatives. It's a simple and positive way to coach someone.</p>
            
            <p>There are four steps in a solution-focused approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify a goal or solution</strong> - What does your team member want to achieve?</li>
                <li><strong>Create a plan</strong> - How can they reach their goal?</li>
                <li><strong>Take action and monitor progress</strong> - Implement the plan and track results</li>
                <li><strong>Change what isn't working</strong> - Adjust the approach as needed</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This model is effective for most people, in most situations. However, if your team member wants to explore the deeper issues behind her behavior or actions, you might want to take a different approach.</p>

        <h2>4.2. Setting up a Coaching Relationship</h2>
        
        <p>Trust and rapport are two of the most important aspects of a successful coaching relationship. Without them, your team member is unlikely to share his thoughts and feelings with you.</p>
        
        <div class="trust-section">
            <h3>Building Trust</h3>
            <p>There are several ways to develop trust with your team member:</p>
            
            <h4>1. Demonstrate Your Credibility</h4>
            <p>Your coachee needs to feel that you have the knowledge and skills to help her. That is why credibility is so important.</p>
            <p>Your existing relationship with your colleague likely makes you a credible coach, but remember that your role as a coach is very different from your role as a manager.</p>
            <p>In your coaching sessions, show confidence by avoiding hesitation, making eye contact, and smiling. But, if you don't have all the answers, don't be afraid to admit it. If you're open and honest with your team member, your credibility will increase. What's more important is that you have the resources to find the answers together.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Show Your Reliability</h4>
            <p>Another important aspect of building trust is reliability. Your team member needs to know that he can depend on you, in every situation.</p>
            <p>To show that you're reliable, make sure that you do what you say you'll do, without fail. Be sure to turn up for your coaching sessions on time, to return messages and calls promptly, and to remain sensitive to your coachee's preferences and expectations.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Make the Other Person Comfortable</h4>
            <p>When your team member feels secure and comfortable, she's more likely to open up and share what she's really thinking. This only tends to develop once you know someone well.</p>
            <p>You can help this process along by sharing some personal information about yourself, too. This doesn't mean that you have to self-disclose every detail about your life! But telling stories from your past, or talking about your values and beliefs, will show that you trust her with your personal information.</p>
            <p>You need to find the right balance between how much to tell her and how much you keep to yourself.</p>
            
            <h4>4. Show That You Care</h4>
            <p>Your coachee needs to feel that you have his best interests at heart, and that your relationship isn't just about improving the quality of his work or increasing his productivity.</p>
            <p>So, take an active interest in his life. Be clear that you are available at short notice if he needs to talk to you. And, if your coaching plan takes longer than you expect to bear fruit, be patient and demonstrate your commitment to the process.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rapport-section">
            <h3>Building Rapport</h3>
            <p>At the start of a coaching relationship, it's important to build a rapport with your team member. But this can be more difficult than it sounds!</p>
            
            <p>To help the process along, find out what the two of you have in common. You can do this by asking her questions about herself, and about what's happening in her life.</p>
            
            <p>The six levels of rapport were originally identified by Gregory Bateson in 1964, and developed further by Robert Dilts in 1990. They are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Environment</strong> - What do you have in common (work, location, background, and so on)?</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior</strong> - Do you do similar things out of work?</li>
                <li><strong>Capability</strong> - Do you share any skills or abilities?</li>
                <li><strong>Beliefs</strong> - Do you have the same values or beliefs?</li>
                <li><strong>Identity</strong> - Do you share a sense of who you are?</li>
                <li><strong>Spirit</strong> - Do you have a similar spiritual outlook on life?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>4.3. Informal Coaching</h2>
        
        <p>You don't have to wait for a structured session to use your coaching skills. Good coaches engage with their team members daily, or weekly.</p>
        
        <p>These informal coaching sessions might be quick, but they can make a huge difference to your team's effectiveness and morale. They can also help you to create stronger and more trusting relationships with your people.</p>
        
        <div class="informal-tips">
            <p>You can identify informal coaching opportunities in several ways:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Keep on Top of Workloads</h3>
            <p>Stay in touch with your team members' workloads. When people are overloaded, or they're trying to juggle too many responsibilities, an informal coaching session can help them to prioritize their tasks, or to gain a clearer understanding of what's most important.</p>
            <p>Adjust your schedule during busy times so that you're available to help when your team members need you.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Be Aware of People's Moods</h3>
            <p>A change in a person's mood might prompt you to start an informal coaching conversation.</p>
            <p>For example, imagine that you've walked by a team member's desk. His shoulders are slumped, his head is down, and he's staring blankly at his computer screen. Sure, he may just be recovering from a big lunch! Or, he might have just learned that his most promising client went to your competitor.</p>
            <p>The point is, his body language is telling you that something is wrong. If he's just eaten too much, you could encourage him to take a quick walk outside. But, if it's something more serious, you're in the right place at the right time for a quick coaching session.</p>
            
            <p>There are many situations where people can benefit from an informal coaching conversation – for example, when they've received feedback, or after a performance review. Team members might also need support if they experience an anticlimax after achieving a major goal, or if a project or presentation didn't go as well as they'd hoped.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Ask for Permission</h3>
            <p>Informal coaching can be a valuable experience for your team member. However, she might not appreciate it if she's in the middle of doing something important!</p>
            <p>Be sure to check that it's a good time to have a coaching conversation.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Don't Tell People What to Do</h3>
            <p>Remember, your goal as a coach is not to offer advice or to give specific instructions. The best coaches ask questions, and listen more than they talk.</p>
            <p>If you find yourself using the words "I think..." during a coaching session, you may need to re-examine your approach.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Use Informal Moments</h3>
            <p>The best time to have an informal coaching conversation is when you both feel relaxed. Rather than organize a formal meeting, you could talk to your team member over a cup of coffee in your break room, or during lunch, instead.</p>
            <p>The goal here is to be relaxed, while remaining professional.</p>
