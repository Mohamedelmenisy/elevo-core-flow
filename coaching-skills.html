        <div class="highlight-section">
            <p>Feedback from people who have received coaching suggests that a coach's most important attributes are personal rapport, confidence, and a sense of humor.</p>
            
            <p>A report by the International Coaching Federation shows that thousands of coaching clients valued rapport and compatibility more highly than a coach's formal education, or his or her years of experience.</p>
            
            <p>This gives you an advantage – because, as a manager, you already have good working relationships with your team members.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="skills-list">
            <p>But coaching requires other important skills, too. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Listening</li>
                <li>Communicating</li>

                <li>Emotional intelligence</li>
                <li>Developing trust</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this chapter, we'll look at these skills in more detail, and discuss how you can improve each one.</p>

            <p>Developing active listening skills is crucial for effective coaching</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1.1. Improving Your Listening Skills</h2>
        
        <p>The ability to listen well is the most important coaching skill. It's key to understanding what the other person is saying on the surface, and to finding out what he or she means on a deeper level.</p>
        
        <p>Specifically, you need good active listening skills. This means that you give your full attention to the other person, and that you're not distracted by thinking of follow-up questions or counter-arguments. You also need to be aware of the person's body language, and how it aligns with (or differs from) what he says.</p>
        
        <p>When you're listening actively, give subtle clues to show that you're paying attention. For example, nod your head and use words like "Yes," or agree with an "Uh huh," when the person is talking. You can also paraphrase what you've just heard to confirm that you've understood it. For example, you might say, "What I'm hearing is..." or, "If I understand what you're saying...."</p>
        
        <p>Another useful skill is empathic listening. This is similar to active listening, but it also requires you to make a concerted effort to understand what the speaker is saying on an emotional level, as well as an intellectual level.</p>
        
        <p>To listen empathically, pay attention to what's being said – and what isn't. Keep in mind that what the speaker holds back is sometimes as important as what she communicates.</p>
        
        <p>Try to keep your own thoughts and opinions out of the conversation, and to focus on the other person. Listen carefully to his vocal tone and inflection, and watch his facial expressions closely. Ask yourself, "How is this person feeling about what he's telling me?"</p>
        
        <p>Mindful listening takes this a stage further, as it enables you to listen without judgment or criticism. The key is to listen "in the moment" – to be aware of your own thoughts and reactions to what is being said without allowing them to distract you from the speaker's message. This ensures that you remain open and receptive to other people's ideas.</p>

        <h2>1.2. Developing Good Communication Skills</h2>
        
        <p>To be an effective coach, you need to know how to communicate your thoughts and ideas clearly. The other person will rely on your expertise and guidance, so it's vital that you get your message across without causing confusion.</p>
        
        <p>Part of effective communication is keeping your opinions and assumptions out of the conversation. This is especially true in coaching, where the focus is always on the coachee. But it's easier said than done, and many of us insert our opinions into a discussion without even realizing it!</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1434030216411-0b793f4b4173?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80"

            <p>Effective communication is key to successful coaching</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Here's an example. Javier is talking to his coach, Susan, about how he's not been able to devote any time to leadership development – a goal that both of them agreed was important for his career.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p><strong>Rahma:</strong> So tell me what has happened this week.</p>
            <p><strong>Mohamed:</strong> I just couldn't find the time to read that leadership development book, or work on the exercises you gave me.</p>
            <p><strong>Rahma:</strong> Was it your boss again? Did he add more to your workload?</p>
            <p><strong>Mohamed:</strong> Yes, he did.</p>
            <p><strong>Rahma:</strong> That probably made you feel stressed and unappreciated, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Mohamed:</strong> Yes, it doesn't make me feel good when he does that. I already have too much to do.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>At first, it might seem that Susan correctly identified that Javier's problem was his boss. But, if you look more closely, you'll see that Susan assumed that this was the case. Then, she steered the conversation in a particular direction with her suggestion that the increased workload made Javier feel "stressed and unappreciated."</p>
        
        <p>By asking a different set of questions, Susan could have helped Javier to come to his own realization about his time management – which might have had nothing to do with his boss!</p>
        
        <p>This simple example shows how easy it is to influence a conversation with your choice of words, phrases and questions.</p>
        
        <p>You can avoid this in your coaching conversations by learning to use Clean Language. This technique was developed by David Groves in the 1980s, and it enables coaches to avoid using words and metaphors that might affect their clients' thoughts and feelings.</p>
        
        <p>The Clean Language technique is useful because it helps the coachee to arrive at his own realizations, without being influenced by you. This allows him to develop greater self-awareness, and means that he will more likely identify the real cause of his problems correctly.</p>
        
        <p>Try to limit your own use of metaphors when you're coaching. But do pay close attention to the metaphors that your coachee uses, as they can offer powerful clues to how he feels about the subject you're discussing.</p>
        
        <p>Here are a few examples of common metaphors:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I can't digest what you're telling me.</li>
            <li>I need to build my leadership skills.</li>
            <li>I'm trapped in my job.</li>
            <li>She's sticking her head in the sand.</li>
            <li>I'm over the moon about my promotion.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It can be a challenge to identify metaphors, because we use them so often. Some are so ingrained in the way we talk that we don't even realize we're using them! But listen out for them in your coaching sessions, as they might help you to identify your team member's hidden or subconscious thoughts.</p>
        
        <p>When your coachee uses a metaphor, you can ask a series of Clean Language questions that will help you to understand his meaning. These are:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>And is there anything else about...?</li>
            <li>And what kind of... is that...?</li>
            <li>And where is...?</li>
            <li>And whereabouts?</li>
            <li>And what happens next?</li>
            <li>And then what happens?</li>
            <li>And what happens just before...?</li>
            <li>And where could... come from?</li>
            <li>And that's like... what?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you use Clean Language, speak more slowly and in a slightly deeper voice than your team member, and try to mimic her intonation and body language as much as possible. This can help her to relax and open up to you.</p>
        
        <p>Using Clean Language takes practice, and some of the questions may sound a bit awkward at first. If so, role-playing can help you to get used to them.</p>

        <h2>1.3. Asking Better Questions</h2>
        
        <p>Great coaches listen more than they talk. And they ask the right questions at the right times – this helps their coachees to understand themselves better.</p>
        
        <p>When you ask questions, your goal is to find out information that can help your team member. Don't take it as an opportunity to voice your own opinions!</p>
        
        <p>Concentrate on asking open-ended questions. These are questions that the other person can't just reply "Yes" or "No" to, and which require her to give a more thoughtful answer. They usually begin with "What?" "Why?" or "How?"</p>
        
        <p>Then, probe for more information with follow-up questions. Ask your coachee for more detail, to provide an example, or to clarify what he has said.</p>
        
        <p>Good questioners also give people adequate time to respond. When you're coaching, make sure that you pause after you ask a question to give your coachee time to think. Don't be tempted to fill the silence!</p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>TIP</strong><br>
            The 5 Whys technique is a simple and effective way to ask probing questions. And our article, <em>Questioning Techniques</em>, helps you to ask questions that encourage self-reflection and exploration.

        <h2>1.4. Learning Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        
        <p>Emotional intelligence is about recognizing your emotions, understanding why you feel a certain way, and knowing how your behavior affects those around you. It's also about sensing others' wants and needs.</p>
        
        <p>When you have emotional intelligence, you can develop stronger relationships, control your emotions more effectively, and know yourself better. All of these elements allow you become a better coach.</p>
        
        <div class="ei-elements">
            <p>Emotional intelligence is made up of five elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Self-Awareness</strong> – The ability to look inward, to think deeply about your behavior, and to consider how it aligns with your ethics and values.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Regulation</strong> – This determines the extent to which you can control your emotions, feelings and impulses.</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation</strong> – People who have high emotional intelligence know how to exchange immediate gratification for long-term success. If you focus on building this skill, you can coach others to do the same.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy</strong> – Putting yourself in other people's shoes, and gaining a better understanding of their perspectives. This trait is incredibly important in coaching.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Skills</strong> – People with high emotional intelligence know how to build and maintain good relationships.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>1.5. Building Trust</h2>
        
        <p>Your coaching relationships with your team members are built on confidentiality and trust. The process only works if your coachee is comfortable sharing his thoughts and feelings with you. If you don't have trust, this won't happen.</p>
        
        <div class="trust-methods">
            <p>There are several ways to build trust in a relationship:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be honest.</strong> People will trust you if they know that they can count on you to tell the truth.</li>
                <li><strong>Share your experiences.</strong> Tell them about the time you made a mistake, or experienced a failure. You can also talk about your values or beliefs.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep your word.</strong> If you make a promise to someone, do whatever it takes (within reason!) to stick to it. If you can't, be upfront and explain why.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspire others.</strong> Demonstrate behaviors such as integrity, respect, loyalty, fairness, and authenticity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We'll learn more about how to develop trust in the next chapter.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>TIP</strong><br>
