        <div class="intro-quote">
            "I haven't got time for coaching! And who needs it, anyway?" If this is your first reaction to what might feel like just another burdensome task, read on.
        </div>
        
        <p>Coaching skills are a valuable asset for any manager. A study by Deloitte found that leaders who frequently coached their teams improved their business results by 21 percent. So, it's no surprise that an increasing number of workplaces consider coaching to be a worthwhile investment. In a survey by the Conference Board Council, 61 percent of the participating organizations used some form of internal coaching.</p>
        
        <p>One reason for this increase is that people who receive coaching can reap considerable benefits. Research by PwC found that, of the participants who had received coaching:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>80 percent had increased self-confidence.</li>
            <li>73 percent had improved relationships.</li>
            <li>72 percent had improved communication skills.</li>
            <li>67 percent reported a better work-life balance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="coaching-image">
            <img src="new-coaching-image.jpg" alt="">
            <p style="text-align: center; color: #777; font-style: italic;">Coaching improves team performance and individual growth</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Numbers like these will likely appeal to any leader, in any industry! But, despite the evidence that effective coaching can make a difference, most managers have very little training in how to do it. The good news is that coaching is a skill that you can learn.</p>
        
        <h2 class="highlight">What Will Coaching Do for Me?</h2>
        
        <p>We'll tell you right now, coaching isn't easy - at least, not if you want to do it well. However, it can be a rewarding and inspiring experience, especially when you see your team racing ahead. When you coach your team members, you may find that your job satisfaction increases, too, and you have a deeper sense of purpose and meaning at work. What's more, you'll likely strengthen your relationship with your team.</p>
        
        <p>But first, you need to gain the knowledge and confidence to be an effective coach. This workbook will guide you through the essential coaching skills. You will learn:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>How to develop good listening skills, emotional intelligence and trust, so that you can establish strong coaching relationships.</li>
            <li>How to coach individual team members.</li>
            <li>How to coach your whole team.</li>
            <li>How to coach yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And, by working through the exercises in each chapter, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the topic and reinforce what you've learned. But first, let's deal with those time pressures and To-Do Lists that dominate your life. Consider how a small investment now in effective, targeted coaching can save you and your team large amounts of time and effort in the future. Purpose and enthusiasm will grow, errors will decrease, and loyalty and collaboration will build. And you'll likely find yourself dealing with less conflict, and delegating more.</p>
