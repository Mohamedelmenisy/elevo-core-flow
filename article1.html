        <p class="highlight">“I haven’t got time for coaching! And who needs it, anyway?” If this is your first reaction to what might feel like just another burdensome task, read on.</p>
        <p>Coaching skills are a valuable asset for any manager. A study by Deloitte found that leaders who frequently coached their teams improved their business results by 21 percent.
        So, it’s no surprise that an increasing number of workplaces consider coaching to be a worthwhile investment.</p>
        <p>One reason for this increase is that people who receive coaching can reap considerable benefits. Research by PwC found that, of the participants who had received coaching:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>80 percent had increased self-confidence.</li>
            <li>73 percent had improved relationships.</li>
            <li>72 percent had improved communication skills.</li>
            <li>67 percent reported a better work-life balance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="highlight">What Will Coaching Do for Me?</h2>
        <p>We’ll tell you right now, coaching isn’t easy – at least, not if you want to do it well. However, it can be a rewarding and inspiring experience, especially when you see your team racing ahead.</p>
        <p>When you coach your team members, you may find that your job satisfaction increases, too, and you have a deeper sense of purpose and meaning at work. What’s more, you’ll likely strengthen your relationship with your team.</p>
