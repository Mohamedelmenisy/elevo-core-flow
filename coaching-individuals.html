    <h1>2. Coaching Individuals</h1>
    
    <div class="orange-bg">
        <p>Deep down, your team members likely already know the answers to their problems. As a coach, your job is to guide them toward this realization.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>One-on-one coaching is a great way to provide this guidance. It's the most common form of coaching, and it's valuable in many ways. For example, it can help your team members to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify career goals, and develop plans to achieve them.</li>
        <li>Improve their time-management and organizational skills.</li>
        <li>Find the right work-life balance.</li>
        <li>Make better decisions.</li>
        <li>Develop skills to work more effectively.</li>
        <li>Reduce stress.</li>
        <li>Build more productive work relationships.</li>
        <li>Think positively.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In an individual coaching relationship, it's important that you are humble, and that you always respect the other person's opinions. Never assume that you have the "right" answer. Make suggestions, but think of yourself as a partner, not a teacher. Remember that most of the time, the solutions to whatever issues your team members have lie within themselves.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, we'll look at some useful models that you can use to frame your one-on-one coaching conversations. We'll also discuss how to build successful coaching relationships, and how you can use coaching techniques informally, as well as in structured sessions.</p>

    <h2 class="blue-heading">2.1. Useful Coaching Models</h2>
    
    <p>You may feel a little daunted by the prospect of coaching another person. After all, if you're like most leaders, you probably haven't received any formal coaching training. So, how do you know what to do or say to guide your team member effectively?</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there are many established models, techniques and approaches that you can use to structure your coaching sessions.</p>
    
    <div class="orange-bg">
        <h3>1. The GROW Model</h3>
        <p>The GROW Model is a simple, yet powerful, coaching tool. GROW stands for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Goal.</li>
            <li>Reality.</li>
            <li>Options.</li>
            <li>Will.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>As a manager, you've likely already identified many of your team member's issues, and that's OK. You can still use the GROW Model as a guide that can help her to explore ideas, to come to her own conclusions, and to identify what she wants to achieve.</p>
        
        <p>To use the GROW Model, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Establish a goal.</li>
            <li>Examine the person's situation.</li>
            <li>Explore the options (or obstacles).</li>
            <li>Agree a plan. The coachee identifies the steps that he needs to take, and commits to specific actions that will move him toward his goal.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>ACTION</h3>
        <p>Use the GROW Model to identify your own challenges and issues. In the table, below, write down the questions you ask yourself as you work through the process. These can be a useful starting point for coaching other people.</p>
        
        <table class="orange-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Questions</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><input type="text" class="required-answer" placeholder="Question 1"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><input type="text" class="required-answer" placeholder="Question 2"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><input type="text" class="required-answer" placeholder="Question 3"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><input type="text" class="required-answer" placeholder="Question 4"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    
    <h3>2. The Skill/Will Matrix</h3>
    
    <p>Your team members all have their own needs, personalities, skills and abilities. This means that you will need to tailor your approach to fit each individual.</p>
    <p>The Skill/Will Matrix, developed by coach and author Max Landsberg in 2003, can enable you to find the appropriate coaching style for every situation.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="skill-will-matrix.png" alt="Skill/Will Matrix" onerror="this.src='https://via.placeholder.com/800x450/ffa726/ffffff?text=Skill+Will+Matrix'">
        <p>Figure 1 - The Skill/Will Matrix</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The matrix is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant represents a different coaching style:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Guide</strong> - This approach is best for people who have high will, but low skill.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegate</strong> - Use this with people who have high skill and high motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct</strong> - Use this approach with people who have low skill and low will.</li>
        <li><strong>Excite</strong> - Use this for people who have high skill, but low motivation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>ACTION</h3>
        <p>Think about the people in your team. Where would you place each of them on the Skill/Will Matrix? Plot each one in the table, below.</p>

        <h3>3. Solution-Focused Coaching</h3>
        <p>The Solution-Focused Coaching approach helps you to identify what your team member wants, and how he can achieve it. Your aim is not to examine why a specific problem is occurring, but to find a solution. This helps you to avoid dwelling on the negatives. It's a simple and positive way to coach someone.</p>
        <p>There are four steps in a solution-focused approach:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify a goal or solution.</li>
            <li>Create a plan.</li>
            <li>Take action and monitor progress.</li>
            <li>Change what isn't working.</li>
        </ol>

    </div>
    
    <h2 class="blue-heading">2.2. Setting up a Coaching Relationship</h2>
    
    <p>Trust and rapport are two of the most important aspects of a successful coaching relationship. Without them, your team member is unlikely to share his thoughts and feelings with you.</p>
    
    <h3>Building Trust</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to develop trust with your team member:</p>
    
    <div class="orange-bg">
        <h3>Building Rapport</h3>
        <p>At the start of a coaching relationship, it's important to build a rapport with your team member. But this can be more difficult than it sounds!</p>
        <p>To help the process along, find out what the two of you have in common. You can do this by asking her questions about herself, and about what's happening in her life.</p>
        
        <p>The six levels of rapport were originally identified by Gregory Bateson in 1964, and developed further by Robert Dilts in 1990. They are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Environment</strong> - What do you have in common (work, location, background, and so on)?</li>
            <li><strong>Behavior</strong> - Do you do similar things out of work?</li>
            <li><strong>Capability</strong> - Do you share any skills or abilities?</li>
            <li><strong>Beliefs</strong> - Do you have the same values or beliefs?</li>
            <li><strong>Identity</strong> - Do you share a sense of who you are?</li>
            <li><strong>Spirit</strong> - Do you have a similar spiritual outlook on life?</li>
        </ol>

    <p>You don't have to wait for a structured session to use your coaching skills. Good coaches engage with their team members daily, or weekly.</p>
    <p>These informal coaching sessions might be quick, but they can make a huge difference to your team's effectiveness and morale. They can also help you to create stronger and more trusting relationships with your people.</p>
